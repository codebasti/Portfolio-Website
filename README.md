# Portfolio Website -
#### _by Sebastian PÃ¼tz_
This project contains my Portfolio Website made with HTML and CSS.
It was made within Udacity's Full-Stack Developer Nanodegree.


## Install and run
1. Download the repository as zip-file an unpack it on your desktop
OR
1. Fork the repository using git/github.
2. Right-Click ```index.html``` and choose "open with [Chrome/IE/Firefox]".

Now your browser should open and you should see my portfolio website.


## Usage
As it is a one-page website, there is not much content hidden on the page,
but as you click one of my featured projects, your browser will open them.
Feel free to travel threw all of them and write an e-mail using the "Contact"-
link at the bottom of the page.
